=What is JSCombiner?=

JSCombiner is a GUI tool that enables you to combine several javascripts on the same folder to a single javascript. 
JSCombiner watches your javascripts to see if there are any changes, and automatically recombines these scripts into one. 
You run it, and forget it. 

=Prerequisites=

To run JSCombiner you must have the following installed:

* Java Runtime Environment >= 1.7.0	(jRuby has a bundled distribution)
* jRuby http://jruby.org/
